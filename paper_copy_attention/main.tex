\title{Attention Is All You Need}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Introduction}
% 再帰型ニューラルネットワーク（RNN）、特に長短期記憶（LSTM）\cite{13} およびゲート付き再帰ネットワーク（GRU）\cite{7} は、系列モデリングや写像（transduction）問題──たとえば言語モデルや機械翻訳\cite{35,2,5}──における最先端の手法として確立されてきた。
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory\cite{13} and gated recurrent neural networks \cite{7}  in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation\cite{35,2,5}.
% それ以来、多くの研究が、再帰型言語モデルおよびエンコーダ–デコーダ構造\cite{38,24,15} の限界をさらに押し広げてきた。
Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures \cite{38,24,15}.

% 再帰モデルは一般に、入力および出力系列の各シンボル位置に沿って計算を分解（factor） する構造を持つ。
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences.
% 計算時間のステップと位置を対応づけることで、彼ら（再帰モデル）は、前の隠れ状態 $h_{t-1}$ と位置 $t$ の入力を関数として、隠れ状態列 $h_t$ を生成する。
Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states $h_t$ as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and the input for position $t$.
% このような本質的に逐次的（sequential）な性質のため、1つの訓練サンプル内での並列化は不可能である。この制約は系列が長くなるほど深刻になり、メモリ制限によって複数サンプル間のバッチ処理も制約を受ける。
This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.
% 最近の研究では、分解（factorization）の工夫\cite{21} や条件付き計算（conditional computation）\cite{32} を通じて、計算効率を大幅に改善する成果が得られている。さらに後者（条件付き計算）の場合には、モデル性能の向上も報告されている。
Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks\cite{21} and conditional computation\cite{32}, while also improving model performance in case of the latter.
% 順次計算に内在する基本的な制約は、しかしながら依然として残っている。
The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.

% アテンション機構は、入力や出力系列内での距離に依存しない依存関係のモデリングを可能にすることで、さまざまなタスクにおける強力な系列モデリングおよび変換モデルの中核的要素となってきた\cite{2,9}。
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modelling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences\cite{2,9}.
% しかしながら、わずかな例外\cite{27}を除き、このようなアテンション機構は再帰型ネットワークと併用されている。
In all but a few cases\cite{27}, however, such attention mechinsms are used in conjunction with recurrent network.
% 本研究では、再帰を排し、入力と出力の間の大域的な依存関係を完全にアテンション機構のみに基づいて捉えるモデルアーキテクチャ「Transformer」を提案する。
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on  an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
% Transformer は著しく高い並列化を可能にし、わずか 8 台の P100 GPU で 12 時間の学習後に翻訳品質で新たな最先端性能を達成できる。
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state othe the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

\section{Background}
% 逐次計算を減らすという目標は、Extended Neural GPU\cite{16}、ByteNet\cite{18}、ConvS2S\cite{9}の基盤にもなっている。これらはいずれも畳み込みニューラルネットワークを基本構成要素として用い、全ての入力・出力位置に対して隠れ表現を並列に計算する。
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\cite{16}, ByteNet\cite{18} and ConvS2S\cite{9}, all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions.
% これらのモデルでは、任意の二つの入力または出力位置間で信号を関連付けるのに必要な演算回数は、その位置間距離に応じて増加する。ConvS2Sでは距離に対して線形、ByteNetでは対数的に増加する。
In these models, the number of operations required to related signals from two arbitrary input of output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet.
% そのため、離れた位置間の依存関係を学習することが難しくなる\cite{12}。Transformerでは、必要な演算回数を定数にまで削減できるが、その代償として、注意重み付きの位置を平均化することによる実効解像度の低下が生じる。これに対しては、Section 3.3で述べるようにマルチヘッド・アテンションで対処する。
This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions\cite{12}. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.3

% セルフアテンション（イントラアテンションとも呼ばれる）は、単一シーケンス内の異なる位置同士を関連付け、シーケンスの表現を計算するための注意機構である。
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence.
%% セルフアテンションは、読解、要約（抽象型）、テキスト含意、そしてタスク非依存の文表現学習\cite{4,27,28,22}など、さまざまなタスクで有効に用いられてきた。
Self-attention has been used successfully in variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independdent sentence representations\cite{4,27,28,22}.

% End-to-end Memory Networks は、シーケンス整合なRNNや畳み込みではなく、再帰的な注意機構に基づいている。
End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.
% 以降の節では、Transformerを説明し、セルフアテンションの動機づけを示し、\cite{17,18}や\cite{9}のようなモデルに対する利点を論じる。
In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as \cite{17,18} and \cite{9}.

\section{Model Architecture}
% ほとんどの競争力のあるニューラル系列変換モデルは、エンコーダ-デコーダ構造を持つ \cite{5,2,35}。
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure\cite{5,2,35}.
% ここで、エンコーダは入力記号列 $\left(x_1,\dots,x_n\right)$ を、連続的な表現の列 $\mathbf{z}=\left(z_1,\dots,z_n\right)$ へ写像する。
Here, te encoder maps input sequence of symbol representations $\left(x_1,\dots,x_n\right)$  to a sequence of continuous representations $\mathbf{z}=\left(z_1,\dots,z_n\right)$.
% 与えられた $\mathbf{z}$ に基づいて、デコーダは出力記号列 $\left(y_1,\dots,y_m\right)$ を1要素ずつ生成する。
Given $\mathbf{z}$., the decoder then generates an output sequence $\left(y_1,\dots,y_m\right)$of symbols one element at a time.
% 各ステップにおいて、このモデルは自己回帰的（auto-regressive）であり、次の要素を生成する際に直前までに生成した記号列を追加入力として利用する \cite{10}。
At each step the model is auto-regressive\cite{10}, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.
% Transformer はこの全体的なアーキテクチャに従い、**スタックされた自己注意機構（self-attention）と点ごとの全結合層（point-wise fully connected layers）**を、エンコーダとデコーダの両方に用いている。これらはそれぞれ 図1の左側と右側 に示されている。
The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder whoen in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.
\subsection{Encoder and Decoder Stacks}
% エンコーダは、$N=6$ 個の同一構造の層から構成されるスタックである。各層は2つのサブレイヤーを持ち、1つ目はマルチヘッド自己注意機構、2つ目は位置ごとに独立した全結合フィードフォワードネットワークである。
\paragraph{Encoder:}The encoder is composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.
% 各サブレイヤーの出力のまわりに残差接続~\cite{11} を施し、その後に層正規化~\cite{1} を適用する。
We employ a residual connection\cite{11} around each of the two sublayers, followed by layer normalization\cite{1}.
% すなわち、各サブレイヤーの出力は$\mathrm{LayerNorm}!\left(x + \mathrm{Sublayer}(x)\right)$の形であり、ここで $\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)$ はそのサブレイヤー自体が実装する関数を表す。
That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm$\left(x+\mathrm{Sublayer}\left(x\right)\right)$, while Sublayer$\mathrm(Sublayer)\left(x\right)$ is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself.
% これらの残差接続を容易にするために、モデル内のすべてのサブレイヤーおよび埋め込み層は、出力次元 $d_{\mathrm{model}} = 512$ を持つ。
To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension $d_\mathrm{model}=512$.

% デコーダも同様に、$N=6$ 個の同一構造の層から構成される。ただし各層には、エンコーダ層にある2つのサブレイヤーに加えて、第3のサブレイヤーが追加されており、これはエンコーダスタックの出力に対してマルチヘッドアテンションを行う。
\paragraph{Decoder:} The decoder is also composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.
% エンコーダと同様に、各サブレイヤーの出力には残差接続を施し、その後に層正規化を適用する。
Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.
% さらに、デコーダスタック内の自己注意サブレイヤーを修正し、ある位置がその後の位置に注意を向けることを防ぐ。
We also modify the self-attention sub layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.
% このマスキングと、出力埋め込みが1ステップ分オフセットされているという事実を組み合わせることで、位置 $i$ の予測が位置 $i$ より前の既知の出力のみに依存することが保証される。
This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position $i$ can depend only on the known outpus at positions less than $i$.

% Q. なんで512なら容易(facilitated)なのか
% A. Transformer では、自己注意層（Self-Attention）フィードフォワード層（Feed-Forward Network, FFN）埋め込み層（Embedding）など、いろいろなサブレイヤーがありますが、これらの出力を次々に残差でつなぐため、出力ベクトルの次元をすべて統一しておく必要があります。つまり「512」は“揃えるための共通の基準"。512 でなければならない理由は理論的にはありませんが経験的に選ばれました。

% Q. 位置ごとに独立したフィードフォワードネットワーク とは例えばLLMなら単語ごとに全結合層を入れてAdd&Normということ
% A. その通り

\subsection{Attention}

An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output. where the query, keys, values and output are all vectors.

The output is computed  as weighted sum of the values, where the weight assinged to each value is computed by compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.

\subsubsection{Scaled Dot-Product Attention}
% 我々はこの注意機構を 「スケールド・ドット積アテンション」（図2）と呼ぶ。
We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2).
% クエリとすべてのキーの内積を計算し、それぞれを $\sqrt{d_k}$ で割り、ソフトマックス関数を適用して値に対する重みを得る。
The input consists of queries and keys of dimension $d_k$, and values of dimension $d_v$. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by $\sqrt{d_k}$, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.

% 実際には、複数のクエリ集合に対して同時にアテンション関数を計算し、それらを行列 $Q$、$K$、$V$ としてまとめて処理する。出力行列は次式で与えられる。
In practice, we compute the attention function on  a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into matrices $K$ and $V$. We compute the matrix of outputs as:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Attention}\left(Q,K,V\right)=\mathrm{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\end{equation}
%一般的に広く使われている2種類のアテンション関数は、加法型アテンション \cite{2} とドット積（乗法型）アテンションである。
The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention \cite{2}, and dot-product(multiplicative) attention.
%ドット積アテンションは、我々のアルゴリズムと同一だが、スケーリング係数 $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ の有無のみが異なる。
Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of $\frac{1}{d_k}$.
% 加法型アテンションは、1層の隠れ層をもつフィードフォワードネットワークによって、クエリとキーの適合度関数（compatibility function）を計算する。
Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer.
% 両者は理論上の計算複雑性としては類似しているが、ドット積アテンションは実装上はるかに高速かつメモリ効率に優れる。これは、高度に最適化された行列積演算として実装できるためである。
While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.

% $d_k$ が小さい場合には両者の性能はほぼ同等であるが、$d_k$ が大きくなると、スケーリングを行わないドット積アテンションよりも加法型アテンションの方が優れた性能を示すことが報告されている \cite{3}。
While for small values of $d_k$ the two mechanisms perform similary, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of $d_k$\cite{3}. 
% 我々は、$d_k$ が大きい場合にはドット積の値の絶対値が大きくなりすぎ、ソフトマックス関数が勾配の極めて小さい領域で飽和してしまうと推測する。この効果を抑えるために、ドット積を $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ でスケーリングしている。
We suspect that for large values of $d_k$, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients. To counteract this effect we scale the dot products by $\sqrt{1}{d_k}$

\subsubsection{Multi-Head Attention}

Instead of performing a single attention function with $d_\mathrm{model}$-dimention keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values $h$ times with different, learned linear projections to $d_k$, $d_k$ and $d_v$ dimensions, respectively.

On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding $d_v$-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subsapces at different positions. With a single attention head, averate inhibits this.

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{MultiHead}\left(Q,K,V\right)&=\mathrm{Concat}\left(\mathrm{head}_1,\dots,\mathrm{head}_h\right)W^O
\\
\mathrm{where}\;\mathrm{head}_i&=\mathrm{Attention}\left(QW^Q_i,KW^K_i,VW^V_i\right)
\end{eqnarray}

Where the projections are parameter matrices $W^Q_i\in\mathbb{R}^{d_\mathrm{model}\times d_k},W^K_i\in\mathbb{R}^{d_\mathrm{model}\times d_k}, W^V_i\in\mathbb{R}^{d_\mathrm{model}\times d_k}$and$W^O_i\in\mathbb{R}^{hd_v\times d_\mathrm{model}}$

In this work we employ $h=8$ parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use $d_k=d_v=d_\mathrm{model}/h=64$.

due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.

\subsubsection{Applications of Attention in our Model}

The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:

\section{Conclusion}

% 本研究では、Transformer を提案した。これは完全にアテンションに基づく初の系列変換モデルであり、エンコーダ–デコーダ構造で一般的に用いられる再帰層を、多頭自己注意（multi-headed self-attention）に置き換えている。
In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self attention.

% 翻訳タスクにおいて、Transformer は再帰層や畳み込み層に基づくアーキテクチャと比べて、著しく高速に学習可能である。
For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers.

On both WMT 2014 Englisht to German and WMT 2014 English to French translation tasks, we achive a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms evan all previously reported ensembles.

% 我々はアテンションベースモデルの将来に大きな期待を寄せており、他のタスクへの応用を計画している。

\subsection{Style}


Papers to be submitted to NeurIPS 2024 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to {\bf nine} pages long,
including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and
references} are allowed. Papers that exceed the page limit will not be
reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the conference.


The margins in 2024 are the same as those in previous years.


Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
rejection.


\subsection{Retrieval of style files}


The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on
the website at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.neurips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+neurips_2024.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.


The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2024 is \verb+neurips_2024.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{} 2.09,
  Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}


The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
\verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.


\paragraph{Preprint option}
If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a
nonanonymized version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit, as long as you do not say which conference it was submitted to. Please \textbf{do
  not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
papers accepted to NeurIPS.


At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.


The file \verb+neurips_2024.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
the paper with your own.


The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.


\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}


The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
indentation.


The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
top of the page.


For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
side.


Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}


All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, and bold.


First-level headings should be in 12-point type.


\subsection{Headings: second level}


Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.


\subsubsection{Headings: third level}


Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.


\paragraph{Paragraphs}


There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
of space.


\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}


These instructions apply to everyone.


\subsection{Citations within the text}


The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.


The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}


If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2024+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}


If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2024}
\end{verbatim}


As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous'' and include a copy of the anonymized paper in the supplementary material.


\subsection{Footnotes}


Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


\subsection{Figures}


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}


All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.


\subsection{Tables}


All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.


Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.


Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.


\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Math}
Note that display math in bare TeX commands will not create correct line numbers for submission. Please use LaTeX (or AMSTeX) commands for unnumbered display math. (You really shouldn't be using \$\$ anyway; see \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to} and \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/40492/what-are-the-differences-between-align-equation-and-displaymath} for more information.)

\subsection{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.


\section{Preparing PDF files}


Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
example, ``A4.''


Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
achieve this.


\begin{itemize}


\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
  "solid" shapes instead.


\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


\end{itemize}


If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
you to fix it.


\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
necessary.

\begin{ack}

\end{ack}

\section*{References}


References follow the acknowledgments in the camera-ready paper. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
when listing the references.
Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.

\section*{NeurIPS Paper Checklist}

%%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.} The checklist should follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material.  The checklist does NOT count towards the page
limit. 

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:
\begin{itemize}
    \item You should answer \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item \answerNA{} means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
    \item Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA). 
   % \item {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.}
\end{itemize}

{\bf The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.} They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "\answerYes{}" is generally preferable to "\answerNo{}", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "\answerNo{}" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "\answerNo{}" or "\answerNA{}" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer \answerYes{} to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading ``NeurIPS paper checklist"},
    \item  {\bf Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.}
    \item {\bf Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers}.
\end{itemize} 
 

%%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Claims}
    \item[] Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
        \item The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. 
        \item The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. 
        \item It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Limitations}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
        \item The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
        \item The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
        \item The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
        \item The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
        \item The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
        \item If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
        \item While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Theory Assumptions and Proofs}
    \item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. 
        \item All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
        \item All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
        \item The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. 
        \item Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
        \item Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 
    \end{itemize}

    \item {\bf Experimental Result Reproducibility}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
        \item If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
        \item If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
        \item Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
        \item While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
            \item If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
            \item If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
            \item We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}


\item {\bf Open access to data and code}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
        \item Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
        \item While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
        \item The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
        \item The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
        \item The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
        \item At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
        \item Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
    \end{itemize}


\item {\bf Experimental Setting/Details}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
        \item The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
        \item The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Experiment Statistical Significance}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
        \item The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
        \item The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
        \item The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
        \item The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
        \item It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
        \item It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96\% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
        \item For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
        \item If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Experiments Compute Resources}
    \item[] Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
        \item The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
        \item The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. 
        \item The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper). 
    \end{itemize}
    
\item {\bf Code Of Ethics}
    \item[] Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics \url{https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines}?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
        \item If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
        \item The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
    \end{itemize}


\item {\bf Broader Impacts}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
        \item If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
        \item Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
        \item The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
        \item The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
        \item If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
    \end{itemize}
    
\item {\bf Safeguards}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
        \item Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. 
        \item Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
        \item We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Licenses for existing assets}
    \item[] Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
        \item The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
        \item The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
        \item The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
        \item For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
        \item If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, \url{paperswithcode.com/datasets} has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
        \item For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
        \item If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf New Assets}
    \item[] Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
        \item Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. 
        \item The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
        \item At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects}
    \item[] Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? 
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
        \item Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. 
        \item According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?
